# Future AppConfig level settings:
# TODO: add time windows where upload/monitoring should be fully paused (e.g. only upload on weekends or at night)

# TODO: add the ability to check that CPU usage has been sufficiently low the past X hours before beginning upload (concerns about an overnight run having been started, even when upload is normally restricted to night time only)

# TODO: (maybe just infra-side) add heartbeat alert time window. add times when not to check for heartbeats (e.g. if computer is regularly turned off at night or weekends)
